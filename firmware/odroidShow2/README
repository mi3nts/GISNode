SHOWtime

SHOWtime is a simple Python script which allows different kinds of information to be displayed
on a ODROID-SHOW. SHOWtime uses tabs to display information; each tab is displayed for a period
of time, after which the tab is changed to the next one.

RUNNING SHOWtime

Assuming you have done everything listed in the INSTALL file, you can run SHOWtime by running

CONFIGURATION

Certain parameters, such as tab change interval, can be set by passing arguments to the script

  --tab, -t:	start from which tab (default=1)
  --time, -T:	for how many seconds should a tab be shown before changing to the next one
		(default=15)
  --port, -p:	serial port to use as the output (default=/dev/ttyUSB0)

Shown tabs and tab-specific settings can be changed in the config.py file.
