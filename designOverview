# Central Node Design Overview

## Introduction 
Portable devices which can detect airbourne particulates are finding its way into current consumer markets. Unlike there bulky, stationary counterparts the small scale nature of such sensors feeds into a more user friendly, hazzle free platform. The current document proposes such a portable device which encorpates a relatively inexpensive particulate sensor with an ensemble of other popular IOT Sensors.

### Design Specifications  

####Necessities 

1. Particulate Sensor: 
 - Must have the Alhpa Sense OPC-N3 <br/>

2. Automated Notifications 
 - Should encorparate a visual aid inorder in bradcasting particulate levels. 

3. Secondary Sensors: 
- Must have Temprature, Humidity, Pressure and GPS sensors.   

4. Camera:
- Should contain an upward looking camera which calculates cloud sky fractions. 

5. Power:
- Would be connected to a permanant source of Power 

6. Date Storage: 
- The device should be capable of storing onboard data.  

7. Data Bradcast:
- Should have the means of bradcasting live data.  

8. Cost 
- The Whole sensor should cost less than 2000$.


##### Attractive Addons 

1. Secondary Sensors: 
- Inclusion of gas sensors such as NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide), O3 (Ozone), CO (Carbon Monoxide), SO2 (Sulfer Dioxide), and H2S (Hydrogen Sulfide). 

2. Mobile App
- Inclusion of an andorid/ios app which will give out live statistics from the data collected.

3. Cost 
- Getting the cost to be less than 1000$.

4. Wi-fy Connectivity 
- Inlcussion of a wireless modem and have the possibiilty of WiFi.
